# Age and Gender Distribution Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`skillcraft-1 (1).ipynb`) for a basic **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** focused on the **age and gender distribution** of a synthetic dataset.

The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization of the age distribution.

## 📊 Key Findings & Visualizations

The notebook generates the following two key visuals:

1.  **Age Distribution (10-year bins):** A bar plot showing the count and percentage of individuals within 10-year age groups (0-9, 10-19, etc.).
    * *Resulting Image:* `age_group_histogram.png` 
2.  **Age Histogram with Median:** A histogram showing the continuous distribution of age, with a vertical line marking the **median age** (calculated as **31.0**). The **mean age** is **33.3**.
    * *Resulting Image:* `age_histogram_median.png` 
## 🛠️ Setup and Dependencies

This analysis requires **Python** and the following libraries:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
